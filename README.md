Project Title: IMDb Sentiment Analysis

Description:
In this project, I tackled the challenging task of sentiment analysis using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. I began by preprocessing a dataset of IMDb movie reviews, cleaning and tokenizing the text, and applying TF-IDF vectorization to transform the reviews into numerical features.

For model training, I employed three different classifiers: Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Random Forest. These classifiers were trained on the TF-IDF features to predict sentiment labels (positive or negative) for the movie reviews.

Here are the key outcomes of this project:

Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 74.43% with a balanced F1-score for both positive and negative sentiments.
SGD Classifier, while fast, showed lower accuracy and skewed towards positive sentiment classification.
Random Forest, despite high accuracy for one class, struggled with overall sentiment classification.
This project serves as a demonstration of text classification and sentiment analysis techniques, providing insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning models for this task. It also showcases data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation steps essential for NLP projects.
